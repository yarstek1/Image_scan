Tool for scanning oscillograms/

To use, you must have a PNG screenshot of an oscillogram. You then have to manually enter the RGB values of the line that plots the signal.
Once you did that, the program scans the image and restores the signal. You can then zero out the noise and compute the amplitude and phase spectrums of the signal.
